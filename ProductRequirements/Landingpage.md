# AfterSave – Landing Page Definition (V1)

## 1. Objective

The landing page must:

* Clearly explain the "post-purchase" concept in under 10 seconds.
* Establish immediate trust around email monitoring and automation.
* Drive users to start onboarding (Sign Up / Connect Email).
* Differentiate from pre-purchase coupon tools.

Primary KPI: Click-through to onboarding.
Secondary KPI: Email connection completion.

## 2. Above the Fold (Hero Section)

### Headline

**Never Overpay After You Buy.**

### Subheadline

AfterSave monitors your order confirmations and keeps shopping for the exact same item while it’s still refundable. If a better deal appears, we help you swap safely.

### Primary CTA

**Start Saving Now**

### Secondary CTA

How It Works

### Trust Signals (Visible Without Scroll)

* Local-first monitoring

Optional: "Average user saves €X/year" dynamic estimate

## 3. Problem Section

### Title

The Most Expensive Moment in E‑Commerce

### Copy

After you click "Buy," the price can still drop.
Most tools stop helping at checkout.
Retailers rarely refund differences anymore.
You either miss the drop — or go through the hassle of canceling and re-buying.

### Visual

Timeline:
Search → Buy → Dead Zone → Delivery
Highlight: "Dead Zone" as opportunity window.

---

## 4. Solution Section

### Title

Turn the Dead Zone Into a Savings Window

### 3-Step Explanation

**1. Detect**
We detect new order confirmations inside your logged-in email session.

**2. Compare**
We search for identical or better-priced offers while cancellation is still possible.

**3. Swap Safely**
We guide you (or prepare everything) to buy the cheaper option and cancel the original order.

Emphasis: No irreversible action without your confirmation.

## 5. Product Modes

### Manual Mode

We send you the better deal and show you exactly what to do.

### Assisted Mode

We prepare checkout and cancellation forms — you confirm the final step.

### (Future) Always Save Mode

Automatic execution when savings exceed your defined threshold.

No. Every irreversible action requires your explicit confirmation.

We provide clear sequencing policies and safeguards to avoid double purchases.
